electron was created in 2018, by iH8Ra1n. (github.com/iHateRa1n)
I AM AWARE THAT IT DOES NOT CURRENTLY BOOT ON HARDWARE, FROM MY TESTING. I WISH TO REMEDY THIS IN THE FUTURE. 
electron is just a hobby project, that I have only successfully booted using the -kernel option in Qemu. 
I am working on getting it to work with the -cdrom option. 

If anyone wants to help me with getting it to boot on x86 REAL HARDWARE, (or the cdrom option in Qemu), please contact me, at repopro4@gmail.com.

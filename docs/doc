SYSCALLS
SET_ALIVE(i); set ALIVE to i. (shutdown if not 0)
add_module(int port, inptr ptr); add kernel module. ptr is a pointer to a function. 
run_module(int port, int i); launch kernel module at port, pass argument i.

ALL modules have to set mod_success to 1 upon succeeding, for electron to know it exited correctly. 
void functions do not look like this:
void func(void){};
void functions look like this:
void func(){};

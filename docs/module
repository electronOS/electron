MODULES
Modules are snippets of code that can be inserted into the kernel, to run in other programs. 
Note that module ports >= 65536 are reserved for the kernel. 
Here is an example of a kernel module. 

void module(int null) {
	printf("elecSH demo module\n");
	mod_success = 1;
	return;
};

INSERTING A MODULE
add_module(1337, &module);

RUNNING A MODULE
run_module(1337, 0);

EXPLANATION
The module code itself, is in MODULE. You can paste this into a C file, and compile it with -m32, and output a .O file, into tmp (make sure you mkdir tmp! ), and when you run build.sh, it will link this into the kernel. 
Make sure you edit the kernel with the INSERTION CODE, and also use the latest commit! 
To run the module, run "run_module(1337, 0);" for this example.
